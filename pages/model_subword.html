<h1>Subword-level word embeddings</h1>
<div class="section" id="motivation">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>capture morphology information</p>
    <p>assign meaningful vectors for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words</p>

    <h3>FastText</h3>
    <p>FastText is probably the most influential and effective recent model. It represents each word as a
        bag-of-character n-grams. Representations for character n-grams, once they are learned, can be combined (via
        simple summation) to represent out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. </p>
    <p>More details about FastText can be found here <a href="https://fasttext.cc/">link</a></p>
    <p>We implemented FastText in Chainer, please see Usage section for more information.</p>

    <h3>CNN and RNN subword-level composition functions</h3>
    <p>We contribute to the discussion of composition functions for constructing subword-level embeddings.
        We propose CNN- and RNN-based subword-level word embedding models, which can embed
        arbitrary character sequences into vectors.</p>
    <p>We also propose a hybrid training scheme, which makes these neural networks directly integrated into Skip-Gram
        model.
        We train two sets of word embeddings simultaneously:
        one is from a lookup table as in traditional Skip-Gram,
        and another is from convolutional or recurrent neural network.
        The former is better at capturing semantic similarity.
        The latter is more focused on morphology and can learn embeddings for OOV words. </p>

    <p>The overall achitecture of the original Skip-Gram, FastText, and our subword-level models are shown in the above
        figure.</p>
